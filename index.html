                Why does software development slow down over time?
                One of the many reasons is that the existing code places <em>constraints</em> on your ability to go forward.
                You must keep all prior features working while adding the next.
            </p>
            <p>This interactive page gives you a simple activity that demonstrates why this happens.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Your Goal</h2>
                    <p>Fill the grid above with the numbers 1 through 9 such that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every cell has a unique number</li>
                        <li id="iteration2Goal" class="hidden">The right side sums to <span id="rightGoal"></span></li>
                        <li id="iteration3Goal" class="hidden">The top sums to <span id="topGoal"></span></li>
                        <li id="iteration4Goal" class="hidden">The diagonal from bottom right to top left sums to <span id="diagonalGoal"></span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Controls</h2>
                    <p>
                        To fill in the grid, just type the numbers on your keyboard.
                        You can also move the selection around using the enter or arrow keys.
