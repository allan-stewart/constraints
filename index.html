            <p>
                Why does software development slow down over time?
                One of the many reasons is that the existing code places <em>constraints</em> on your ability to go forward.
                You must keep all prior features working while adding the next.
            </p>
            <p>This interactive page gives you a simple activity that demonstrates why this happens.</p>

            <div class="activity">

                            To fill in the grid, just type the numbers on your keyboard.
                            You can also move the selection around using the enter or arrow keys.
                        </p>

                            <p>It took you <span class="duration1">[duration]</span> to complete the first part of the exercise.</p>
                            <p>Your next task is to update your grid so that the right side sums to a specific number.</p>

                                    You did that quickly; it only took you <span class="duration2">[duration]</span>.
                                    Perhaps you are quick at math?
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    That took you <span class="duration2">[duration]</span>.
                                    Why was it slower?
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Next, you will be asked to update your grid so that the top row sums to a specific number, while also maintaining the right side sum.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div id="feedback3" class="hidden">

                                <p>Your grid already had the correct sums, so there wasn't anything for you to do.</p>

                                    You only took <span class="duration3">[duration]</span> to complete the task.
                                    That's quick!
                                    Is this getting harder yet?
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    That took you <span class="duration3">[duration]</span>.
                                    Why did it take so long?
                                    You've only been asked to arrange 9 numbers on a grid, after all...
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                For the final task, you need to get the bottom-left to top-right diagonal to sum to a specific value.
                                Of course, you'll still need to maintain the top and right sums.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>For the four tasks, these were your times:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Task 1: <span class="duration1">[duration]</span></li>

                                What made the activity harder as you progressed?
                                What was different about the last task compared to the first?
                            </p>
